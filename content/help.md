## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

The Cytoverse team greatly appreciates users bringing any unexpected behavior to our attention 
as well as requesting additional functionality or documentation that they would be helpful. For any of these 
purposes please open an issue on the GitHub page for the relevant package repository, all of which can be found
from the [RGLab GitHub homepage](https://github.com/RGLab/).

Whenever possible, but particularly if you are reporting a bug, please try to generate a reproducible
example (or "reprex") for generating the unexpected behavior. The [reprex](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) package
can assist in rendering your code nicely in to markdown that can be added to the issue. If your example 
depends on particular files (workspace files, raw data, etc.) please let us know that as well. This is not often the case
as most issues can be reproduced using example data included with our packages, particularly in [flowWorkspaceData](https://github.com/RGLab/flowWorkspaceData). If the privacy of the data is not of great concern
(or it is sufficiently de-identified), you may post it directly to the issue. Otherwise, we can certainly arrange a more private transfer of data.

## Contribute

On occasion some of our users not only request additional functionality from our packages, but prototype or develop
it themselves. This is of course welcome, but you should always post an issue first so that we can make sure
the requested functionality is not already present (and maybe not fully documented yet) so as to avoid duplication of
effort. Furthermore, design considerations for the entire Cytoverse ecosystem may push us to develop more robust/general 
solutions over single-task additions.
