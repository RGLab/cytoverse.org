title: "Citing the Cytoverse"
---

If you find the Cytoverse software packages to be useful in your research leading to a publication, develop
tools that depend on these packages, or reproduce code from these packages in your own software, please
appropriately cite the paper corresponding to initial development of the corresponding package(s).

Citations are incorporated in to each of the packages, so these can be easily obtained from within R by 
(using flowWorkspace as an example):   
`citation("flowWorkspace")`   
The citations are also available from the [Bioconductor page for each package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowWorkspace.html).
