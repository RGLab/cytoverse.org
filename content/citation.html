<script src="/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js"></script>


<p>If you find the Cytoverse software packages to be useful in your research leading to a publication, develop
tools that depend on these packages, or reproduce code from these packages in your own software, please
appropriately cite the paper corresponding to initial development of the corresponding package(s).</p>
<p>Citations are incorporated in to each of the packages, so these can be easily obtained from within R by
(using flowWorkspace as an example):</p>
<pre><code>citation(&quot;flowWorkspace&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The citations are also available from the <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowWorkspace.html">Bioconductor page for each package</a>.</p>
