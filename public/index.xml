      <description>If you find the Cytoverse software packages to be useful in your research leading to a publication, develop tools that depend on these packages, or reproduce code from these packages in your own software, please appropriately cite the paper corresponding to initial development of the corresponding package(s).
Citations are incorporated in to each of the packages, so these can be easily obtained from within R by (using flowWorkspace as an example):</description>

      <description>Bundled Installation The most recent stable release of the packages can be installed from Bioconductor in R by running:
BiocManager::install(&amp;quot;cytoverse&amp;quot;)
The most current development versions can obtained from Github by running: devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;RGLab/cytoverse&amp;quot;)
Individual Packages A number of packages are very useful in coordination with the core cytoverse packages but are not included in the bundled installation above. Some examples include flowStats and flowClust.
These can be installed in a similar way to the bundled installation above, either from Bioconductor</description>

      <description>Getting Started The Cytoverse team continually works to make the packages more approachable to new users, even as new tools are added. To that end, the best place to start is with the package vignettes. All of the Cytoverse packages have a number of vignettes intended to provide a brief introduction to the role they serve. After installation, these can be accessed from within R by running browseVignettes(&amp;quot;package_name&amp;quot;) where &amp;ldquo;package_name&amp;rdquo; would be &amp;ldquo;flowWorkspace&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;openCyto&amp;rdquo;, or whichever package you needed to learn about.</description>
